# My Favorite Recipes

Project from The Odin Project for HTML Foundations

In this project I will practice:

    1. Create a repository using Git/Github
    2. Create directories/files from the terminal and to open them
    3. Use VSCode to a simple HTML website

As lessons advance I will add css/js elements to this page
